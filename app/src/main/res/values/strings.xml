        If you\'re looking for something specific on SoundCloud, whether it\'s an audio, music or song tracks.
        you\'re in luck. The search interface is pretty simple to use, you don\'t even have to be logged into SoundCloud to search!

       \nGo to the Home tab and then click in the box across the top of the screen labelled \"Search\" and begin typing in what you\'re looking for.

        \nClick a result to play or download it as long as if its authorised by its author.
